## Description

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it.

## Setup

* Access a web browser of your choice
* _open the html.index file to access the quiz board_
* _read the playng rules_
* _enter the names of the two players and hit "submit"_
* _plaer 1 starts by rolling the dice and holding if they so wish after the first roll_
* _player 2 rolls the dice after player one rolls and holds_
* _repeat the cycle until the first person to get to 100 is declared winner_
* _refresh the page and play again in a fresh game_

_For example, the first player, Anne, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Anne could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score._

###Gameplay

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

*If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

*If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

*If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

*If a player rolls snake eyes (two 1s), then they lose their total score and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.


## Technologies Used
